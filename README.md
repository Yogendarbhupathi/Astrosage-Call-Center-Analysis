This project focuses on optimizing AstroSage’s call and chat consultation operations using data analysis and strategic planning. AstroSage, a leading astrology service provider, received a ₹1 crore investment to improve its customer experience and operational efficiency. The project analyzes performance data, identifies key issues, and proposes actionable strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and maximize revenue.

🎯 Problem Statement:   
Despite a large customer base, AstroSage faces operational inefficiencies such as high rates of incomplete calls and low customer ratings. The goal of this project is to analyze existing data, understand the root causes of inefficiencies, and recommend solutions to improve service quality and resource allocation.
